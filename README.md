 CLI/Lution is a lght weight alternative to Evo/Lution. This iso boots directly to console and uses Carl Duff's Lution-AIS installer. The purpose of this iso is to reduce the iso size by eliminating everything not necessary for installing Arch, such as xorg, a window manager, etc. 

CLI/Lution uses a modified version of Carl Duff's initialisation script to download the latest version of a user selectable lution-ais stable or testing. See the repo: https://github.com/jeffscode/initialization-script for additional details and access to the code.
