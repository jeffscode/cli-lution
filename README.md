# cli-lution 

This is the archiso build for CLI/Lution.

 CLI/Lution is a lght weight alternative to Evo/Lution. This iso boots directly to console and uses Carl Duff's Lution-AIS installer. The purpose of this iso is to reduce the iso size by eliminating everything not necessary for installing Arch, such as xorg, a window manager, etc. It runs in root with no password and boots directly to console with resolution settings options.
  
CLI/Lution also uses a modified version of Carl's initialisation script to download and start the latest version lution-ais. See the repo for additional details: https://github.com/jeffscode/initialization-script
